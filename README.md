# Linkly

> Linkly is a C++ compile-time meta programming library for building composable operator pipelines.  
> This library is intended for developers wishing to create their own DSL using ultra-high-performance, fully compile-time and type-safe operator pipelines.

## Motivation
Originally, my plan was to implement a fluent design system for the front end of my ECS game engine. I started a week ago and I had never dealt with this kind of concept before.  I then got to work and began developing a small, entirely compile-time system. Gradually, this small side project transformed into a full-fledged project, which itself evolved into a library.  

The main problem with chaining compile-time operators is that it's difficult to extract information from the next node and adapt that node to the conditions of the previous one if everything is compiled-time.  
The solution, using template and `using` statements, allows me to model and recreate subsequent nodes from scratch with their original attributes, but adding the types and information of the current node, such as the data container or size constraints, for example.

This project is the culmination of my journey learning metaprogramming in C++, which I naively began a little less than two months ago. This is my first library ever, and I'm sure there are many things that can be improved. Feel free to share your suggestions!

## Installation

Instructions on how to install, include, or build the library.

### Requirements
- **C++ Standard:** C++11 up to C++26  
- **Compilers:** GCC 11+, Clang 13+, MSVC 2019+ (any compiler supporting C++11 to C++26)  
- **Dependencies:** Only the C++ standard library (`<tuple>`, `<type_traits>`, `<concepts>`, `<utility>`, `<iostream>`). No external dependencies.

### Include
This library is **header-only**, so you just need to include the main header in your project:

```cpp
#include "linkly.hpp"
using namespace linkly;
````

---

## Usage

Basic usage of the library involves creating operator chains and terminating them with `Result` or your own implementation.

### Step 1: Create a pipeline

```cpp
#include "linkly.hpp"
using namespace linkly;

// Create a FunctionOperator pipeline
auto pipeline = FunctionOperator<SubscriptOperator<>>{};

// Equivalent explicit template version specifying arity, state, and next operator
auto pipeline = FunctionOperator<0, std::tuple<>, SubscriptOperator<0, std::tuple<>, End>>{};
```

### Step 2: Execute the pipeline

```cpp
#include "linkly.hpp"
using namespace linkly;

// Provide some arguments; the pipeline collects them internally
pipeline(0, 250, 500)[750, 1000];
```

### Step 3: End the pipeline

```cpp
#include "linkly.hpp"
using namespace linkly;

// Automatically terminates when pipeline reaches End
auto final_state = pipeline(10, 20)[30, 40, 50]; // returns collected arguments
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Specify the size of arguments

```cpp
#include "linkly.hpp"
using namespace linkly;

auto pipeline = SubscriptOperator<3,
                    FunctionOperator<5,
                        SubscriptOperator<> // 0 = no constraints by default
                    >
                >{};

pipeline[0, 10, 20](30, 40, 50, 60, 70)[80]; // Compiles

pipeline[0, 10](20, 30, 40)[50]; // Doesn't compile
```


### Example 2: Implement your own operator

#### Base provided by the API

```cpp
#include "linkly.hpp"
using namespace linkly;

template<typename>
struct FunctionOperatorBase;

template<
    template<std::size_t, typename, typename> class DerivedOperator,
    std::size_t Arity,
    typename Next,
    typename State
>
struct FunctionOperatorBase<DerivedOperator<Arity, Next, State>> {
    using Derived_t = DerivedOperator<Arity, Next, State>;

    template<typename... Args>
    auto operator()(Args&&... args) 
        -> std::enable_if_t<
            (Arity == 0 || sizeof...(Args) == Arity),
            decltype(std::declval<Derived_t>().onOperated(std::forward<Args>(args)...))
        >
    {
        return static_cast<Derived_t*>(this)
            ->onOperated(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    }
};
```

---

#### Implementation using this base

```cpp
#include "linkly.hpp"
using namespace linkly;

template<
    std::size_t Arity,
    typename Next,
    typename CurrentState
>
struct FunctionOperator_ :
    OperatorTraits<FunctionOperator_<Arity, Next, CurrentState>>,
    FunctionOperatorBase<FunctionOperator_<Arity, Next, CurrentState>>,
    StatefulOperator<CurrentState>
{
    FunctionOperator_(CurrentState s = DEFAULT_STATE_VALUE)
        : StatefulOperator<CurrentState>(std::move(s)) {}

    template<typename... Args>
    auto onOperated(Args&&... args) noexcept(false) {
        auto concat_state_args = std::tuple_cat(
            this->state_,
            std::make_tuple(
                std::make_tuple(std::forward<Args>(args)...)
            )
        );

        if constexpr (is_terminal<Next>::value)
            return End{ concat_state_args };
        else
            return Next::template template_type<
                Next::arity,
                typename Next::next_type,
                decltype(concat_state_args)
            > (std::move(concat_state_args));
    }
};
```
